            <p>am inclined to think—” said I.
“I should do so,” Sherlock Holmes
remarked impatiently.
I believe that I am one of the most
long-suffering of mortals; but I’ll admit that I was
annoyed at the sardonic interruption.
“Really, Holmes,” said I severely, “you are a
little trying at times.”
He was too much absorbed with his own
thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his
untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the
slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it
up to the light, and very carefully studied both the
exterior and the flap.
“It is Porlock’s writing,” said he thoughtfully. “I
can hardly doubt that it is Porlock’s writing, though
I have seen it only twice before. The Greek e with
the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is
Porlock, then it must be something of the very first
importance.”
He was speaking to himself rather than to me;
but my vexation disappeared in the interest which
the words awakened.</p>
